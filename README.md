>
> [Brian's repo](https://github.com/btholt/citr-v6-project), his [notes](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-react-v6/)

## Raw Notes
- Setting up Brian's repo as a submodule, changed the remote name from origin to upstream, in case I wish to edit the repo and push the changes to my GitHub.
- I started about 2 hours late, missed the intro, came in when discussing tooling, will work from the beginning during the lunch break to get caught up.
- To format code, without globally installing prettier, run the cmd: `npx prettier`
  - With `prettier` installed as a dev dependency, and a script set with the name "format" in the `package.json` file, you can run `npm run format` and clean up your code.

# Intro to React and Intermediate React Workshop
> Frontend Masters workshop, lead by Brian Holt on Thursday 2021-03-11 - Friday 2021-03-12
> [Brian's repo](https://github.com/btholt/citr-v6-project), his [notes](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-react-v6/)

## Raw Notes
- Setting up Brian's repo as a submodule, changed the remote name from origin to upstream, in case I wish to edit the repo and push the changes to my GitHub.
- I started about 2 hours late, missed the intro, came in when discussing tooling, will work from the beginning during the lunch break to get caught up.
